# Helm client use private registry

In this tutorial, I will show how to use helm client to interact with a private chart registry.
- Add the private repo to the helm client
- Create a custom helm chart
- publish the chart to the private repo
- Deploy an instance by downloading the helm chart from the private repo.

> In this tutorial, the private registry is built by using the chartmuseum.

## 1. Add the private registry to the helm client

In this example, the private registry uses the basic auth to authenticate users

```shell
# add the registry to helm client
# I named the repo as cm
helm repo add --username admin --password changeMe cm https://chart.casd.local/

# look up available charts in the repo
helm search repo cm
```

## 2. Create a custom helm chart

Now let's create a new chart with name `mario`. This chart will deploy the famous game `mario` as a web page game.

```shell
# below command creates a chart skeleton
# the name of the chart provided here (e.g. mario) 
# will be the directory's name where the chart is created and stored.
helm create mario

# check the content of the generated mario folder
tree -L 3 mario/

# the architecture of the generated skeleton
mario/
├── charts
├── Chart.yaml
├── templates
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── _helpers.tpl
│   ├── hpa.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   ├── NOTES.txt
│   ├── serviceaccount.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   └── tests
│       └── test-connection.yaml
└── values.yaml

```

Let's understand the relevance of these created files and folders:

- **charts**: This is an optional directory that may contain sub-charts
- **Chart.yaml**: This is the main file that contains the description of our chart
- **templates**: This is the directory where Kubernetes resources are defined as templates
- **values.yaml**: This is the file that contains the default config values for our chart
- **.helmignore**: This is where we can define patterns to ignore when packaging (similar in concept to .gitignore)

Suppose we have an origin deployment, service and ingress configuration as shown below.

- **mario_deployment.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mario
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mario
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mario
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mario
          image: reg.casd.local/casd/docker-supermario
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: harbor-auth
```
- **mario_service.yaml**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mario
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - name: http
      targetPort: 8080
      port: 80
  selector:
    app: mario
```

- **mario_ingress.yaml**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-mario
spec:
  # tls:
  #   - hosts:
  #       - mario.kub.sspcloud.fr
  rules:
    - host: mario.casd.dev
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: mario
                port:
                  number: 80
```

In general, you need to at least modify the below files in the generated skeleton:
 - `Chart.yaml`: name, description of the app. Pay attention of the value of `appVersion`, it will be used in the 
                 template `templates/deployment.yaml` as default image tag if the image tag value is empty in `values.yaml`.
 - `templates/deployment.yaml`: You need to adapt the template based on the origin `deployment.yaml`. For example, the 
     `containerPort` value depends on how the image is build. In general, the default value will not work.
 - `templates/service.yaml`: You need to adapt the template based on the origin `service.yaml`. For example, the 
     `targetPort` value depends on how the `deployment.yaml` is specified. You can't put a value which does not match.
 - `templates/ingress.yaml`: You need to adapt the template based on the origin `ingress.yaml`.
 - `values.yaml`: This stores all default value of the chart. If user provide nothing, the deployed instance will use
                the value in this file.

You can find the complete chart example in [src/k8s/helm/custom_chart/mario](../../../../src/k8s/helm/custom_chart/mario).

> Once, the chart is published, the user only need to modify the `values.yaml` to deploy it on a k8s cluster. If user
> need to modify the template, it means the chart is not well-designed.

### 3.1 Validating a chart

Before you deploy your chart, it's recommended that you valid your chart first (well-formed). 
You can use **helm lint** to do that. Below command is an example

```shell
# validate the chart syntax
helm lint ./mario
```

You can also render the generated k8s resource with the given default values.yaml

```shell
helm template ./mario
```

### 3.2 Deploy a release with helm chart

Once we've verified the chart to be fine, finally, we can below command to install the chart into the Kubernetes cluster

```shell
helm install mario-test ./mario

# you can view the deployed release 
helm ls -n <name-space>

# upgrade your release with new chart version
helm upgrade mario-test ./mario

# you can notice that after each upgrade, the revision number increase, so you can rollback
# with any number that inferior than current. Below example will rollback to 1
helm rollback mario-test 1

# delete the release
helm uninstall mario-test
```

## 4. Publish your chart to private registry

The below steps only works for registries built by `chartmuseum`. 
There are two ways to push charts to ChartMuseum:
- via the `api of chartMuseum`
- via `helm cm-push plugin`, the easiest way is to use helm cm-push plugin. You can find the official github page [here](https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push)

### 4.1 Publish via the api

```shell
# package your chart source
cd mario/
helm package .

# this command will generate a .tgz file. The version comes from the version value of `Chart.yaml`
mario-0.1.0.tgz 

# upload the binary to the registry
# if you have setup an auto redirect from http to https, you must call https in the curl command, 
# otherwise you will get a 301 status error due to the redirection.
curl --data-binary "@mario-0.1.0.tgz" https://chart.casd.local/api/charts

# If you’ve signed your package and generated a provenance file, upload it with:
curl --data-binary "@mario-0.1.0.tgz.prov" https://chart.casd.local/api/prov

# upload the package and provenance file at same time
curl -F "chart=@mario-0.1.0.tgz" -F "prov=@mario-0.1.0.tgz.prov" https://chart.casd.local/api/charts

# check if a chart exists in the registry or not, this will return a list of all available charts
curl https://chart.casd.local/api/charts

# delete a chart
curl -X DELETE https://chart.casd.local/api/charts/mario/0.1.0
```

### 4.2 Publish via cm-push plugin

The `cm-push plugin` is not installed by default, you need to install it first.

```shell
# install the plugin
helm plugin install https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push

# check the installed plugin
helm cm-push  --help

# add your private chartmuseum as a repo
helm repo add --username admin --password changeMe cm https://chart.casd.local/

# push the chart, with the plugin, you don't need to do helm package anymore
# you can push the directory directly, the plugin will package the chart, then push
helm cm-push mario/ cm

# Push .tgz package is still supported
helm cm-push mario-0.1.0.tgz cm

# push with a custom version
helm cm-push mario/ --version="0.2.0" cm

# If your ChartMuseum install is configured with ALLOW_OVERWRITE=true, chart versions will be automatically overwritten upon re-upload.
# Otherwise, the upload will be denied with message file already exist. Unless your install is configured with DISABLE_FORCE_OVERWRITE=true (ChartMuseum > v0.7.1), you can use the --force/-f option to to force an upload to overwrite an existing chart
helm cm-push --force mario-0.2.1.tgz chartmuseum

# push without adding chart repo. Below example shows how to push to an repo directly
helm cm-push mario-0.2.1.tgz http://chart.casd.local/

```

To check if the register is updated or not. You can follow the below commands

```shell
# list all available repo
helm repo list

# update the index of a repo
helm repo update

# Search a chart on all the added repo with a give keyword
helm search repo <repo-name>

# if you want to use regex, you need to use option -r
helm search repo -r "*mario*"

# to further filter your result, you can add an grep after
helm search repo -r "nginx" | grep -i "bitnami"
```

## 5. Remove the private registry

```shell
# Remove a repo
helm repo remove <repo-name>
```
