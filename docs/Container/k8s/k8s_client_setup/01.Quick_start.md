# K8s clients

To interact with a k8s cluster, you need at lest two clients:
- kubectl
- helm

## 1. kubectl 

**kubectl** is a command line tool for communicating with a Kubernetes cluster's control plane, using the Kubernetes API.

For configuration, it looks for a file named `config` in the `$HOME/.kube` directory. You can specify other 
kubeconfig files by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or by setting the `--kubeconfig` flag.

### 1.1 Installation

You can find the official doc [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

You can follow the below steps to install it. Below instruction are tested for x86-64 architecture.

```shell
# 1. Download the binary with curl 
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"

# 2. Get the hash of the binary
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"

# 3. validate the binary by checking the hash
echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check

# 4. copy bin to your local bin
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

# 5. check the installation
kubectl version

# output example
Client Version: v1.31.2
Kustomize Version: v5.4.2
The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?

```

> The default config is pointing to localhost:8080, we need to replace it with the k8s api server url.
> 

### 1.2 Configuration

As we mentioned, the default config file is located at ``. Below is an example of the config content. 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: changeMe
    server: https://k8s-master:6443
  name: kubernetes
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: kubernetes
    user: kubernetes-admin
  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes
current-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: kubernetes-admin
  user:
    client-certificate-data: changeMe
    client-key-data: changeMe
```

> You can notice the access control in the k8s cluster is RBAC.
> 
Normally, the admin of the k8s cluster will provide you the login(username), and the credential(e.g. password, token, etc.)

You can find the official doc of API access control [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/)

## Helm

You can find the official installation doc [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). You need to choose a version which is
compatible with your k8s cluster and your local OS(e.g. linux-amd64, windows-amd64, etc.).

The available version can be found [here](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases).

For example, in below example, we choose version `3.16.2`.

```shell
# get the source
wget https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.16.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz


tar -xzvf helm-v3.16.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz

chmod a+x linux-amd64/helm

mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm

# add the bitnami repo
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

# show available charts in the bitnami repo
helm search repo bitnami
```

> Check [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) for all public available Helm chart repositories.
