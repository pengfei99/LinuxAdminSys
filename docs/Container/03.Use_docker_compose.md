# Docker compose 

In previous tutorial, we have seen how to use docker to run single container. Imagine that we have a list of container 
to run for one service, and they need to be coordinated. For this kind of situation, we can use docker compose.

Docker compose is used to manage applications and increase efficiency in container development. Configurations are
defined in a single YAML file, making applications easy to build and scale. 

In short, Docker Compose uses a single **docker-compose.yml** configuration file to create a list of services(i.e. containers).

## Requirements

To run docker compose, you need both Docker Engine and Docker Compose binaries. There are two ways:

- Install standalone binaries of Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
- Install Docker Desktop, It contains the Development environment with graphical user interface 
            including Docker Engine and Docker Compose.

## Installation

Check the first tutorial [01.Install_docker_dockerCompose.md](./01.Install_docker_dockerCompose.md).

## Important terms

There are three important component in the **docker-compose.yml** file:
 - services
 - volumes
 - networks

A simple example of **docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  ...
volumes:
  ...
networks:
  ...

```
