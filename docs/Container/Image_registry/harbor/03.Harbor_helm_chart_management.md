# Harbor helm chart management

Since version 1.6.0, Harbor allows users to manage helm chart.

If you are not familliar with Helm chart, please read the [helm_chart.md](../k8s/Helm_chart.md) first.

There are three options to push helm charts to Harbor

1. Use the helm [chartmuseum/helm-push plugin](https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push) to push Helm chart to Harbor
2. Use the Harbor web UI to upload and download the helm chart (a *.tgz file)
3. Since version 3.8 Helm support pushing and pulling Charts from OCI compliant container registries such as Harbor.

In this tutorial, we choose `option 3`, as **Chartmuseum is already marked as deprecated in Harbor**.

## Link helm cli with harbor

As a helm chart repository, Harbor can work smoothly with Helm CLI. Run command `helm version` to make sure the version of Helm CLI is v3.8.1+.


```shell
# check helm version
helm version

# example output
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.9.4", GitCommit:"dbc6d8e20fe1d58d50e6ed30f09a04a77e4c68db", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.17.13"}

# helm oci registry config 
helm registry login -u admin reg.casd.local

```


## Push charts to repository server

```shell
# general form for pushing helm chart to harbor
helm push <char-package> oci://<harbor-url>/<project-name>

# an example of pushing chart
helm push hello-world-0.1.0.tgz oci://reg.casd.local/test
```

## Pull and install charts from repository server
Below pulling command will pull the tgz file to your current directory. Unlike with the common helm command where you would first `add a repo` and then `pull from it`. With OCI registry, you can install a Chart with one line without adding the OCI registry repository(project) one by one.

```shell
# general form for pulling
helm pull oci://<harbor-url>/<project-name>/<chart-name> --version <chart-version>

# an example for pulling chart
helm pull oci://reg.casd.local/test/hello-world --version 0.1.0

# general form for installing a release from a remote chart
helm install <release-name> oci://<harbor-url>/<project-name>/<chart-name> --version <chart-version>

# an example for installing a release
helm install myrelease  oci://reg.casd.local/test/hello-world --version 0.1.0
```

## Extra command for helm to interact with oci

Helm also provides various other subcommands for the oci:// protocol. 

```shell
helm pull
helm show
helm template
helm install
helm upgrade
```

> As OCI registry does not have the notion of repository, you can't do a search on the repo to get all the helm chart list
