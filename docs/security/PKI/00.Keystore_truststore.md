# Generating a KeyStore and TrustStore

The following sections explain how to create both a **KeyStore and a TrustStore** (or import a certificate into an 
existing TrustStore such as the default Logical Host TrustStore in the location

## Creating a keystore in JKS format

This section explains how to create a KeyStore using the JKS format as the database format for both the private key, 
and the associated certificate or certificate chain. By default, as specified in the `java.security` file, **keytool 
uses JKS as the format of the key and certificate databases (KeyStore and TrustStores)**. A CA must sign the 
certificate signing request (CSR). The CA is therefore trusted by the server-side application to which the Adapter 
is connected.

```shell
# To Generate a KeyStore
keytool -keystore clientkeystore -genkey -alias client

# Once prompted, enter the information required to generate a CSR. A sample key generation section follows.
