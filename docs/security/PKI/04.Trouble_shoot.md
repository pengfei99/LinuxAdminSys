# Trouble shoot common certificate problems

## certificate relies on legacy Common Name field

The origin error message:

```text
x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0
```

The cause: **Golang beyond 1.17 doesnâ€™t support certificates using CNs.**



The proposed solution:

```shell
openssl req -new -key certs/foo-bar.pem \
    -subj "/CN=foobar.mydomain.svc" \
    -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:foobar.mydomain.svc" \
    -out certs/foo-bar.csr \
    -config certs/foo-bar_config.txt
```
