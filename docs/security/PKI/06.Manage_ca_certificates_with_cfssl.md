# Use CFSSL to manage ca

## 1 What is CFSSL?

**CFSSL is CloudFlare's PKI/TLS swiss army knife**. It is both a command line tool and an HTTP API server for signing, 
verifying, and bundling TLS certificates. It requires Go 1.16+ to build.

You can visit the official [repo](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) for more information.

CFSSL consists of a set of packages useful for building custom TLS PKI tools
- The `cfssl` program, which is the canonical command line utility using the CFSSL packages.
- The `multirootca` program, which is a certificate authority server that can use multiple signing keys.
- The `mkbundle` program is used to build certificate pool bundles.
- The `cfssljson` program, which takes the JSON output from the cfssl and multirootca programs and writes certificates, keys, CSRs, and bundles to disk.

## 2 Installation

The current latest release is `v1.6.5`. The below steps install the required packages

```shell
mkdir -p /tmp/cfssl

cd /tmp/cfssl

vim install_cfssl.bash

# add the below lines in the .bash
# Define version
CFSSL_VERSION="1.6.4"

# Download binaries
curl -LO "https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases/download/v${CFSSL_VERSION}/cfssl_${CFSSL_VERSION}_linux_amd64"
curl -LO "https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases/download/v${CFSSL_VERSION}/cfssljson_${CFSSL_VERSION}_linux_amd64"
curl -LO "https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases/download/v${CFSSL_VERSION}/cfssl-certinfo_${CFSSL_VERSION}_linux_amd64"

# Make them executable
chmod +x cfssl_${CFSSL_VERSION}_linux_amd64 \
        cfssljson_${CFSSL_VERSION}_linux_amd64 \
        cfssl-certinfo_${CFSSL_VERSION}_linux_amd64

# Move to /usr/local/bin
sudo mv cfssl_${CFSSL_VERSION}_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssl
sudo mv cfssljson_${CFSSL_VERSION}_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
sudo mv cfssl-certinfo_${CFSSL_VERSION}_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssl-certinfo
```

After installation, you can check the tool version with the below commands

```shell
cfssl version
cfssljson --version
cfssl-certinfo --version
```

## 3. Generate a certificate authority

To generate a CA certificate and private key with cfssl, we need two files:
- **config.json**: defines certificate signing policies
- **csr.json**: defines the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) metadata.

We will work in a folder called `local_ca`, the generated certificate will be stored in the `creds` directory.

```bash
# create working folder
mkdir -p ~/local_ca/creds

cd ~/local_ca
```

### 3.1 Define certificate signing policies

The **config.json** in CFSSL defines:
- **certificate signing policies**
- **usage constraints**
- **expiration settings**. 

It is used with the `cfssl sign` or `cfssl serve` commands to control how certificates are issued by a 
`Certificate Authority (CA)` either manually or via an API.

#### 3.1.1 The general form

Below is the structure of the `config.json`.
```json
{
  "signing": {
    "default": { ... },
    "profiles": {
      "name1": { ... },
      "name2": { ... }
    }
  }
}

```

The top level is **signing** that defines the overall **signing behavior**. It contains:
- **default**: the `fallback signing policy` when no profile is specified
- **profiles**: named `custom signing policies` to apply during signing

The second level defins the signing behaviors:

```json
{
"intermediate_ca": {
  "expiry": "28800h",
  "usages": [
    "signing",
    "digital signature",
    "key encipherment"
  ],
 "ca_constraint": {
    "is_ca": true,
    "max_path_len": 0,
    "max_path_len_zero": true
  }
}
}
```

- *expiry*: lifetime of the signed certificate (e.g., 28800h = 3.3 years)
- *usages*: key usages and extended key usages
- *ca_constraint*: whether the cert is a CA, and how deep the CA chain may go

The allowed value is `usages``:

| Usage	             | Purpose                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| signing	           | For certificate signing (CAs only) |
| cert sign	         | Sign certificates (CAs only)       |
| crl sign	          | Sign certificate revocation lists  |
| digital signature	 | For TLS handshake signatures       |
| key encipherment	  | Encrypt symmetric keys in TLS      |
| server auth	       | Authenticate TLS servers           |
| client auth        | 	Authenticate TLS clients          |


The `ca_constraint` controls whether a certificate can act as a CA.
- `is_ca: true`: marks the certificate as a CA
- `max_path_len:0`: how many sub-CAs can be beneath this one, 0 means no ca allowed beneath this one
- `max_path_len_zero: true`: enforces zero-length CA chains (true means no child CAs).

With the below ca_constraint, the `intermediate CAs` can issue `one more level of CA certificates`.
```json
"ca_constraint": {
  "is_ca": true,
  "max_path_len": 1,
  "max_path_len_zero": false
}
```

## 4 A real-world example

To illustrate a real-world example, we start by defining a signing policy and a `CSR`. We will put all the config
files in `~/local_ca`



### 4.1 Create a signing policy

We will use a default template to start the edition 

```bash
# go to the working directory
cd ~/local_ca

# generates a signing policy template
cfssl print-defaults config > config.json
```

```shell
#Edit the config.json and put the below lines
{
  "signing": {
    "default": {
      "expiry": "87600h",
      "usages": [
        "signing",
        "digital signature",
        "key encipherment"
      ]
    },
    "profiles": {
      "intermediate_ca": {
        "usages": [
          "signing",
          "digital signature",
          "key encipherment",
          "cert sign",
          "crl sign"
        ],
        "expiry": "43800h",
        "ca_constraint": {
          "is_ca": true,
          "max_path_len": 0,
          "max_path_len_zero": true
        }
      },
      "peer": {
        "usages": [
          "digital signature",
          "key encipherment",
          "client auth",
          "server auth"
        ],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      },
      "server": {
        "usages": [
          "digital signature",
          "key encipherment",
          "server auth"
        ],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      },
      "client": {
        "usages": [
          "digital signature",
          "key encipherment",
          "client auth"
        ],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this config, the default expiry date is 10years, the intermediate ca is 5 years.

### 4.2 Create Root CA csr


```bash
# go to the working directory
cd ~/local_ca

# generates a csr template
cfssl print-defaults csr > csr.json

# here we create a csr for root ca
vim root-ca-csr.json
```
Now, you can put the below lines in the `root-ca-csr.json` file.

```json
{
  "CN": "CASD k8s Root CA",
  "key": {
    "algo": "ecdsa",
    "size": 384
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "FR",
      "L": "Malakoff",
      "O": "CASD",
      "OU": "Data science"
    }
  ],
  "ca": {
    "expiry": "87600h"
  }
}
```

### 7.3.2 Generate Root CA certificate

We use the above `root-ca-csr.json` to issue the following certificate authority for `casd.local` in two files:

- `ca.pem`, the certificate authority;
- `ca-key.pem`, the private key linked to this certificate authority.

```bash
# this command will generate three files: ca.csr, ca.pem, ca-key.pem
# note the creds/ca is the prefix of the output file, if you put toto,
# the generated file will be toto.csr, toto.pem, etc.
cfssl gencert -initca root-ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare creds/root-ca
```

You can check the generated certificate by using below command

```bash
openssl x509 -in casd-signed.pem -text -noout
```

### 7.3.1 Root CA profile config

The `config.json` file parameterizes the subsequent creation of subsidiary certificates for this certificate authority. 
It defines the capabilities of the `CA` for different usage (`profile`) of the certificates, which change depending on the needs.

Check the generated `config.json`

```json
{
    "signing": {
        "default": {
            "expiry": "168h"
        },
        "profiles": {
            "www": {
                "expiry": "8760h",
                "usages": [
                    "signing",
                    "key encipherment",
                    "server auth"
                ]
            },
            "client": {
                "expiry": "8760h",
                "usages": [
                    "signing",
                    "key encipherment",
                    "client auth"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}

```
You will notice the default expiration time is too short. We can put it to `28800` = 1200 days.
In the `profiles` section, we define the capabilities of the `CA` for each profile.

Below is an example of config.json, for `intermeidate_ca` issued by this ca, it has `signing, client authentication, server authentication, certificate signing, key encipherment` capacities.

```json
{
  "signing": {
    "default": {
      "expiry": "28800h"
    },
    "profiles": {
      "intermediate_ca": {
        "usages": [
            "signing",
            "digital signature",
            "key encipherment",
            "cert sign",
            "crl sign",
            "server auth",
            "client auth"
        ],
        "expiry": "8760h",
        "ca_constraint": {
            "is_ca": true,
            "max_path_len": 0, 
            "max_path_len_zero": true
        }
      },
      "peer": {
        "usages": [
            "signing",
            "digital signature",
            "key encipherment", 
            "client auth",
            "server auth"
        ],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      },
      "server": {
        "usages": [
          "signing",
          "digital signing",
          "key encipherment",
          "server auth"
        ],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      },
      "client": {
        "usages": [
          "signing",
          "digital signature",
          "key encipherment", 
          "client auth"
        ],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
For our case, we will use a simpler [config.json](../../resources/cfssl/config.json)

## 7.4 Use cases of CA

### 7.4.1 Issue an intermediate certificate

First create a csr of the intermediate certificate. 

```intermediate.json
{
  "CN": "Onyxia Intermediate CA",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C":  "FR",
      "L":  "PARIS",
      "O":  "CASD",
      "OU": "Servers Intermediate CA"
    }
  ],
  "ca": {
    "expiry": "42720h"
  }
}
```
Generate the public key pair
```bash
mkdir intermediate; cd intermediate 

# This command will generate intermediate.csr  intermediate-key.pem  intermediate.pem
cfssl gencert -initca intermediate.json | cfssljson -bare intermediate
```
Now we need to sign the intermediate with ROOT CA

```bash
# -ca specifies the Root certifcate
# -ca-key specifies the private key of the Root certificate
# -config specifies the CA config file
# -profile specifies the profile name in the config file follow by the csr which needs to be signed
# cfssljson -bare will translate the json output into the standard .pem format
# intermediate/intermediate is the prefix of the output file 
cfssl sign -ca creds/ca.pem \
  -ca-key creds/ca-key.pem \
  -config config.json \
  -profile intermediate intermediate/intermediate.csr | cfssljson -bare intermediate/intermediate

# You should see below output
[INFO] signed certificate with serial number 196691997370633874902371540997745783818537484259
```

### 7.4.2 Singing a website certificate

Create a csr with below `minio-server.json` file.

```json
{
  "CN": "minio.casd.local",
  "key": {
    "algo": "ecdsa",
    "size": 384
  },
  "names": [
  {
    "C": "FR",
    "L": "Paris",
    "O": "CASD",
    "OU": "Computing Webserver1"
  }
  ],
  "hosts": [
    "minio.casd.local",
    "localhost"
  ]
}
```

```bash
cfssl sign -ca creds/ca.pem \
  -ca-key creds/ca-key.pem \
  -config config.json \
  -profile=server minio.json | cfssljson -bare minio-server1
```

### 7.4.3 Signing a wildcard certificate

Step1: Create a csr with below `wildcard-casd.json` file.
```json
{
  "CN": "*.casd.local",
  "hosts": [
    "*.casd.local",
    "casd.local"
  ],
  "key": {
    "algo": "ecdsa",
    "size": 384
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "FR",
      "L": "Malakoff",
      "O": "CASD",
      "OU": "Data Science"
    }
  ]
}
```
```bash
mkdir wildcard; cd wildcard

vim wildcard-casd.json
# this command will generate two files: wildcard-casd.csr, wildcard-casd-key.pem
# note the creds/ca is the prefix of the output file, if you put toto,
# the generated file will be toto.csr, toto.pem, etc.
cfssl genkey wildcard-casd.json | cfssljson -bare wildcard-casd
```
The above command will generate three file:
- wildcard-casd.csr : request
- wildcard-casd-key.pem  : private key


Step2: Sign the csr with root CA
```bash
cfssl sign -ca creds/root-ca.pem \
  -ca-key creds/root-ca-key.pem \
  -config config.json \
  -profile=server wildcard/wildcard-casd.csr | cfssljson -bare wildcard-casd
```
The above command will generate two files:
- wildcard-casd.pem: your wildcard certificate signed by the root CA
- wildcard-casd.csr: the copie of the signing request



#### Check output certificate

After the generation, we need to test the validity of the certificate and the private key. Most importantly, we need to
check if the private key and the certificate matches

```bash
# You can verify the generated certificate content with below command
openssl x509 -in casd-signed.pem -text -noout

# verify the validity of the private key in rsa
openssl rsa -check -noout -in wildcard-casd.key 

# verify the validity of the private key in ecdsa
openssl ec -check -noout -in wildcard-casd.key 

# normal output
> RSA key ok

# Get the Modulus Value of the certificate
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in casd-signed.pem

# Get the Modulus Value of the Private Key of rsa
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in wildcard-casd.key 


# to facilitate the comparison, we can convert the modulus into md5
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in casd-signed.pem | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in wildcard-casd.key | openssl md5 
```

> For ECDSA, you can not test the conformity by getting the modulus. But we can extract public key
from the private key and the signed certificate. If the extracted public key is the same. Then the
private key and certificate is a match.

```shell
# general form to get the public key from private key
openssl pkey -in wildcard-casd-key.pem -pubout

# get the public key from certificate
openssl x509 -in casd-signed.pem -pubkey
```

#### Perform Encryption with Public Key from certificate and Decryption with Private Key
You can follow the below step to encrypt and decrypt the data
```shell
# 1. Get the public key from the certificate
openssl x509 -in casd-signed.pem -noout -pubkey > pubkey.cer

# 2. Encrypt test.txt file content using the public key
# Create a new file called test.txt file with the content "message test". Perform the following command to 
# create an encrypted message to cipher.txt file.
openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -in test.txt -pubin -inkey pubkey.cer -out cipher.txt 

# 3. Decrypt from cipher.txt using the private key
openssl  pkeyutl  -decrypt -in cipher.txt -inkey wildcard-casd.key
```


### 7.4.4 Bundling Certificates

**mkbundle** is used to build the root and intermediate bundles used in verifying certificates. It basically 
chains the end certificate with the intermediate CA and Root CA public keys. 

It takes a collection of certificates, checks for CRL revocation (OCSP support is planned for the next release) 
and expired certificates, and bundles them into one file. It takes directories of certificates and certificate 
files (which may contain multiple certificates). For example, if the directory intermediates contain a number of 
intermediate certificates, run: `mkbundle -f bundle.crt intermediates`

In order to bundle our certificates, ensure that the Root CA public key (ca.pem) and the intermediate public 
keys are in the same directory. All of mine will be copied into the bundle directory. Let us follow the convention 
above to bundle our generated certificates.

```bash
mkdir bundle

cp creds/ca.pem bundle/.
cp intermediate/intermediate.pem bundle/.
mkbundle -f minio-server1.crt bundle

```

## 7.5 Add/Remove certificate as trusted CA

We can add a certificate as a trusted certificate in a Server (CA or not). 

### For debian

To add a CA: 
```bash
# note you must change the .pem to .crt, otherwise, it won't work
sudo cp creds/ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates

# Remove your CA.

```

Another solution, you only need to copy the certificate to the `/etc/ssl/certs/` folder

```
sudo cp creds/ca.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt
```

To remove a CA

```bash
# remove the ca.crt
# Update the CA store
sudo update-ca-certificates --fresh

```
### For Centos

```bash
# Install the ca-certificates package: 
yum install ca-certificates

# Enable the dynamic CA configuration feature: 
update-ca-trust force-enable

# Add it as a new file to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/: 
cp foo.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/

# Update ca trust store
update-ca-trust extract
```

### For Windows

```bash
# Add	root CA
certutil -addstore -f "ROOT" ca.crt

# Remove root CA	
certutil -delstore "ROOT" serial-number-hex
```

### For MacOS

```bash
# Add root CA	

sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/ca.crt

# Remove root CA
sudo security delete-certificate -c "<name of existing certificate>"
```

## 7.5 Certificate format

A complete doc can be found [here](https://www.sslmarket.fr/ssl/help-la-difference-entre-certificats)

### PEM format

**PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail)** is a widely used format for storing and sharing cryptographic objects such 
as `X.509 certificates, private keys`, and other related information. PEM files are typically 
**ASCII-encoded, with a header, the data, and a footer**. Below is a general template for a PEM-encoded X.509 certificate:

```shell
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<base64-encoded certificate data>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```
The general file extension are: `.cer, .crt, .pem` for certificate or  `.key` for private key.

### DER format

The X.509 certificate is typically encoded in binary `DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format`. DER is a standard 
for encoding data structures defined by the `Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) standard`.

You can convert a PEM format certificate

```shell
openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -outform der -out certificate.der
```
