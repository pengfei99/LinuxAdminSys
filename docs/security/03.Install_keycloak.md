# Install keycloak on debian 11

This tutorial shows how to install and config a keycloak server in a scripted manner. The objective is: 

- enable installation automation without K8s cluster
- enable the usage of variables for supporting various environments
- enable idempotence (the script can be executed multiple times producing the same results)

You can find the official doc https://www.keycloak.org/documentation.html

> Keycloak Operator can only be used in a Kubernetes based runtime.

We will follow below key Steps 
1. Installing and starting the Keycloak server
2. Connecting the Admin CLI
3. Configuring
## Step 0 : Prerequisites

### Create user account

For good practice, we should run the `keycloak.service` with a service account(e.g. specific User and Group). 
In this tutorial, we decide to use `keycloak` as the username and group name.

You can create the user and group using the `groupadd and useradd` commands. The following example creates the user, group, 
and working directory for keycloak. These commands typically requires root (sudo) permissions.

```shell
sudo groupadd -r keycloak

sudo useradd -r -g keycloak -d /opt/keycloak -s /sbin/nologin keycloak

sudo mkdir -p /opt/keycloak

# change the owner of the data folder
sudo chown keycloak:keycloak /opt/keycloak

```

### Install jdk

Keycloak requires Java to work. You can check and verify that Java is installed with the following command.
Base on the keycloak version, you need to install the required jdk version.
In this tutorial, for keycloak 23.0.4, we use jdk-17
```shell
# check if java installed
java -version

# install jdk 17 (debian 11)
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```


## Step 1: Installing and starting the Keycloak server 

We can install the keycloak en mode:
- bare metal
- container(e.g. docker, k8s, etc.)

### Installation en mode bare metal

Download of the Keycloak distribution.

```shell
# fix the kc version which you want to download
export KC_VERSION=23.0.4
curl -LO  https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/download/"${KC_VERSION}"/keycloak-"${KC_VERSION}".zip

# copy the bin into the working directory
sudo mv keycloak-${KC_VERSION}.zip /opt/keycloak

# unpacking the archive.
unzip keycloak-${KC_VERSION}.zip

# 
cd keycloak-${KC_VERSION}

# add execute acl on bin folder
sudo chmod o+x bin

# This directory contains a Keycloak Quarkus application.
# When we start the server for the first time, we have to set the admin user and the admin password:
# You can notice all the config is done by setting env var not in a config file. Because it's designed with cloud native
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YVqs7p4bJaim3rQ2FSI8 ./bin/kc.sh start-dev

# When we start again, it is not necessary to set these variables, again. You can start the server with:
./bin/kc.sh start-dev

# start-dev runs the quarkus application in DEV-mode. Do not use this for Production.
# By default, the Keycloak server is using the following ports. They are only served from the localhost loopback address 127.0.0.1:
# 8080 for Keycloak using HTTP
# One of the last lines from the log output is:
# 2023-04-11 13:23:29,545 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Keycloak 21.0.2 on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.13.7.Final) started in 4.418s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
# 
```

> We can now open the Administration Console from localhost and do the login with the just created admin user.


The distribution also contains the `Admin CLI`. This is the shell script **./bin/kcadm.sh**.

We define the `environment variable KCADM for the kcadm.sh` script. 

```shell
# It must be the absolute path to the 
# kcadm.sh script from the above Keycloak installation.
# general form
export KCADM="/path/to/keycloak/bin/kcadm.sh"
# in our tutorial
export KCADM="/opt/keycloak/keycloak-23.0.4/bin/kcadm.sh"
export HOST_FOR_KCADM=localhost
```

### Installation en mode docker image

To install and run Keycloak as a docker container a single command is necessary.

```shell
#  
export KC_VERSION=23.0.4

# create a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:${KC_VERSION} start-dev
```

In the next steps we are using the Admin CLI script (kcadm.sh). It is also contained in the Keycloak docker image. 
This means every call of the Admin CLI is executing the script from within the docker image.

```shell
docker run --rm --entrypoint /opt/keycloak/bin/kcadm.sh quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:${KC_VERSION}
```
We define the environment variable KCADM for the above command. Additionally, we mount the `$HOME/.keycloak` folder 
from the docker host at `/opt/.keycloak`.

```shell
export KCADM="docker run --rm --entrypoint /opt/keycloak/bin/kcadm.sh -v ${HOME}/.keycloak:/opt/keycloak/.keycloak quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:${KC_VERSION}"

# When we executed $KCADM successfully the following output is shown:
Keycloak Admin CLI

Use 'kcadm.sh config credentials' command with username and password to start a session against a specific
server and realm.

```

When executing this script with a command (like config, create, get etc.) it connects to the Keycloak instance running 
in another docker container. Depending on the docker environment you are using, the host name of the Keycloak instance 
must be specified differently. For Docker Desktop environments the host name can be defined as `host.docker.internal`.


```shell
export HOST_FOR_KCADM=host.docker.internal
```


## Step2: Starting the keycloak server

### In development mode

This mode offers convenient defaults for developers to get the keycloak server up and running quickly. 

```shell
# To start in development mode, enter the following command:

bin/kc.[sh|bat] start-dev
```

You can write a little script to run the service on the background. **Not recommended for the production usage**



```shell
#!/bin/bash
export KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin
export KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YVqs7p4bJaim3rQ2FSI8

nohup path/to/keycloak/bin/kc.sh start-dev --proxy edge  --hostname-strict=false --hostname=keycloak.casd.local &
```

Development mode sets the following default configuration:

 - HTTP is enabled
 - Strict hostname resolution is disabled
 - Cache is set to local (No distributed cache mechanism used for high availability)
 - Theme-caching and template-caching is disabled

### In production mode

This mode follows a secure by default principle.

```shell
To start in production mode, enter the following command:

bin/kc.[sh|bat] start

```

Without further configuration, this command will not start Keycloak and show you an error instead. This response is 
done on purpose, because Keycloak follows a secure by default principle. Production mode expects a hostname to be 
set up and an HTTPS/TLS setup to be available when started.

Production mode sets the following defaults:

  - HTTP is disabled as transport layer security (HTTPS) is essential 
  - Hostname configuration is expected 
  - HTTPS/TLS configuration is expected

Before deploying Keycloak in a production environment, make sure to follow the steps outlined in Configuring 
Keycloak for [production](https://www.keycloak.org/server/configuration-production).

### Creating the initial admin user

You can create the initial admin user by using the `web frontend`, which you access using a local connection 
(localhost). You can instead create this user by using environment variables. Set `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=<username>` for 
the initial admin username and `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>` for the initial admin password.

Keycloak parses these values at first startup to create an initial user with administrative rights. Once the first 
user with administrative rights exists, you can use the Admin Console or the command line tool kcadm.[sh|bat] to 
create additional users.

If the initial administrator already exists and the environment variables are still present at startup, an error 
message stating the failed creation of the initial administrator is shown in the logs. Keycloak ignores the 
values and starts up correctly.

### Optimize the Keycloak startup

We recommend optimizing Keycloak to provide faster startup and better memory consumption before deploying Keycloak 
in a production environment. 

By default, when you use the start or start-dev command, Keycloak runs a build command under the covers for 
convenience reasons.

You can run the build command explicitly. Below are some examples

```shell
# get all build command options 
bin/kc.[sh|bat] build --help

# Run a build to set the database to PostgreSQL before startup
bin/kc.[sh|bat] 

# below is an example
sudo ./bin/kc.sh build --db=postgres 

# after the build process, you can check the config of the build result
sudo ./bin/kc.sh show-config
```

For example, you can add below conf in the `conf/keycloak.conf` file

```shell
# Basic settings for running in production. Change accordingly before deploying the server.

# Database

# The database vendor.
db=postgres

# The username of the database user.
db-username=keycloak

# The password of the database user.
db-password=changeMe

# The full database JDBC URL. If not provided, a default URL is set based on the selected database vendor.
db-url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/keycloak

# Observability

# If the server should expose healthcheck endpoints.
#health-enabled=true

# If the server should expose metrics endpoints.
#metrics-enabled=true

# HTTP

# The file path to a server certificate or certificate chain in PEM format.
https-certificate-file=/opt/keycloak/keycloak-23.0.4/conf/wildcard-casd.pem

# The file path to a private key in PEM format.
https-certificate-key-file=/opt/keycloak/keycloak-23.0.4/conf/wildcard-casd.key

# The proxy address forwarding mode if the server is behind a reverse proxy.
#proxy=reencrypt

# Do not attach route to cookies and rely on the session affinity capabilities from reverse proxy
#spi-sticky-session-encoder-infinispan-should-attach-route=false

# Hostname for the Keycloak server.
hostname=keycloak.casd.local

```

After a successful build, you can start Keycloak and turn off the default startup behavior by entering the following
command:

```shell
bin/kc.[sh|bat] start --optimized <configuration-options>
```

> The `--optimized` parameter tells Keycloak to assume a pre-built, already optimized Keycloak image is used. As 
a result, Keycloak avoids checking for and running a build directly at startup, which saves time.

For more information you can visit this page. https://www.keycloak.org/server/configuration

## Step3 : Connection the admin CLI

Now we connect the `Keycloak Admin CLI` to the API and authenticate with the user created previously. We use two 
environment variables created in Step 1:

- $KCADM
- $HOST_FOR_KCADM

Please make sure they are defined. Their definition is dependent on the runtime you have chosen.

We log in to the master realm with the admin user. By using the options config credentials we request and maintain an 
authenticated session, which is used for all further calls. Be aware the access and refresh tokens for this session will be stored in the file $HOME/.keycloak/kcadm.config.

```shell
$KCADM config credentials --server http://$HOST_FOR_KCADM:8080 --user admin --password YVqs7p4bJaim3rQ2FSI8 --realm master
```

To check the successful authentication and an authenticated session, we make a first request to the API.

```shell
$KCADM get serverinfo
```

The Keycloak server responds with a dump of information about its state and functionality. The same information is 
also available within the Web Admin Console.

## Step3: Creating a SystemD Service File for Keycloak

If everythion goes well in step 1 and 2, it means we have a keycloak server ready. To facilitate the keycloak 
service management, Now we will create a systemD service config file.

### configuration directory for Keycloak

Create a configuration directory for Keycloak under /etc directory by the name keycloak.

```shell
$ cd /etc/
$ sudo mkdir keycloak
```

The keycloak distribution contains a default config template which locate at `/path/to/keycloak/conf/keycloak.conf` 
We can use it as our start point, so copy it to  `/etc/keycloak/` and rename it to keycloak.conf

```shell
# in our example, our keycloak path is /opt/keycloak/keycloak-23.0.4
sudo cp /opt/keycloak/keycloak-23.0.4/conf/keycloak.conf /etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf
```


## Create a systemd service for keycloak

If you followed the above tutorial, you should have one keycloak server on mode bare-metal ready to run.

To do a test run, you can use the below command.
```shell
sudo ./bin/kc.sh start --proxy edge --hostname-strict=false --http-port=8080 --log=file --log-file=/var/log/keycloak/keycloak.log
```


You can also create a systemd daemon to better control the keycloak service. 

```text
# Create a file
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/keycloak.service

# put the below content
[Unit]
Description=Keycloak Server
After=syslog.target network.target
Wants=network.target

[Service]
Type=notify
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_SYS_ADMIN
User=keycloak
Group=keycloak
Environment=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.17.0-openjdk-amd64
# this needs to be reviewed in production env
ExecStart=/opt/keycloak/current/bin/kc.sh start --proxy edge --hostname-strict=false --http-port=8080 --log=file --log-file=/var/log/keycloak/keycloak.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You can now control the keycloak daemon with systemd

```shell
sudo systemctl start/status/stop/restart keycloak
```


## Set a reverse proxy

In this tutorial, I used nginx, you can use other product. Below is a nginx server config example. This works fine
with direct grant request. If you use an app to integrate keycloak, you may encounter the 
**CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing** issue. To resolve this issue, you need to modify the 
below config to add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the http response header. For more details, check

```shell
# set a backend upstream for keycloak server
upstream keycloak_backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080 fail_timeout=0;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name keycloak.casd.local;

  # Redirect all traffic to SSL
  rewrite ^ https://$host$request_uri? permanent;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl default_server;

  # enables SSLv3/TLSv1, but not SSLv2 which is weak and should no longer be used.
  ssl_protocols SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  
  # disables all weak ciphers
  ssl_ciphers ALL:!aNULL:!ADH:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM;

  server_name keycloak.casd.local;

  ## Access and error logs.
  access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
  error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log info;

  ## Keep alive timeout set to a greater value for SSL/TLS.
  keepalive_timeout 75 75;

  ## See the keepalive_timeout directive in nginx.conf.
  ## Server certificate and key.
  ssl_certificate /opt/keycloak/keycloak-23.0.4/conf/wildcard-casd.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /opt/keycloak/keycloak-23.0.4/conf/wildcard-casd.key;
  ssl_session_timeout  5m;

  ## Strict Transport Security header for enhanced security. See
  ## http://www.chromium.org/sts. I've set it to 2 hours; set it to
  ## whichever age you want.
  
  location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $mapped_server_port;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_pass http://keycloak_backend;
    }
  
}

```


## Testing the keycloak service

### Set up keycloak client

1. Create a new realm(e.g. Data-catalog)
2. Create a client inside the realm which you just created (e.g. open-metadata )
3. In the `Capability config/Authentication flow` section, select two options `standard flow`, and `direct access grants`
4. In the `Capability config/Client authentication` section, enable it. This will set up a password for the `open-metadata` client
5. Get the password from the `credentials` Tab.

### Get an access token
This curl command will get a token from the `open-metadata` client in realm `Data-catalog`(generated by keycloak server).

```shell
# 
curl -k -X POST https://keycloak.casd.local/realms/Data-catalog/protocol/openid-connect/token \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -d 'grant_type=password' \
     -d 'client_id=open-metadata' \
     -d 'client_secret=HZDISp4LEuLL96ozs6cN2p4HftHKY62P' \
     -d 'scope=openid' \
     -d 'username=jsnow' \
     -d 'password=jsnow'
```

### Verify User access token

```shell
curl -k -X GET https://keycloak.casd.local/realms/Data-catalog/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access-token>'
```

> If your token is not valid, you will not receive the user info. If everything goes well, you will have the below 
> response

```json
{
    "sub": "d0618826-8b2f-4853-a216-5b342d2c0452",
    "email_verified": false,
    "name": "John Snow",
    "preferred_username": "jsnow",
    "given_name": "John",
    "family_name": "Snow",
    "email": "jsnow@casd.local"
}
``` 
 
Below are some useful urls
```
# you can get the realm configuration with the below url
https://keycloak.casd.local/realms/Data-catalog/.well-known/openid-configuration

# you can get the token endpoint
https://keycloak.casd.local/realms/examples/protocol/openid-connect/token

```

### Use postman to test the above request

1. Create a new collection `keycloak API test`
2. Create a request `Get keycloak access token`, this will simulate the first curl request
3. In `Get keycloak access token`, In http method, choose `POST`, in url, put `https://keycloak.casd.local/realms/Data-catalog/protocol/openid-connect/token`
   In `Headers`, add two row `Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `Accept:application/json`. In `Body`,
   add the below rows `grant_type:password client_id:open-metadata client_secret:changeMe scope:openid username:jsnow password:jsnow`
4. Copy the access token in the response body
5. Create a new request `Verify keycloak access token`
6. In http method, choose `GET`, in url, put `https://keycloak.casd.local/realms/Data-catalog/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo`
   In `Authorization`, in `Type` choose `Bearer token`, Copy the access token in Token input line.
7. After sending the request, you should receive the repose with user profile

> The default access token is only valid for 5 mins, so it's normal your token is no longer valid after 5 mins. You can
 Change this in Keycloak -> realm settings -> token

## Troubleshoot

### CSS loading issue after hosting keycloak on linux with nginx as proxy server

https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/12719

### CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing

You can find more info about this issue here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSMissingAllowOrigin

You can also check this page https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/react-cors-guide-what-it-is-and-how-to-enable-it/

The response to the CORS request is missing the required Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, which is used to determine 
whether the resource can be accessed by content operating within the current origin.

To correct this issue, you need to add below lines

```text
# set default values for the cors values 
  set $cors_origin "";
  set $cors_cred   true;
  set $cors_header "Content-Type";
  set $cors_method "POST, GET";

# if requests comes from the allowed domain or subdomain, we assign certain core values 
# nginx create variables for http header, for example the origin header has the equivalent variable $http_origin in nginx 
  if ($http_origin ~* (https?://.*\.mckinsey\.com(:[0-9]+)?$)) {
            set $cors_origin $http_origin;
            set $cors_cred   true;
            set $cors_header $http_access_control_request_headers;
            set $cors_method $http_access_control_request_method;
  }

# if request comes from null origin, we set another group of core values
 if ($http_origin ~ 'null') {
            set $cors_origin "null";
            set $cors_cred   true;
            set $cors_header $http_access_control_request_headers;
            set $cors_method $http_access_control_request_method;
  }

# add header to the Http response
  add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin      $cors_origin;
  add_header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials $cors_cred;
  add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers     $cors_header;
  add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods     $cors_method;
 
  location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_pass http://keycloak_backend;
    }

```
