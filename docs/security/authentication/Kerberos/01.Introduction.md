# Introduction of Kerberos server

**Kerberos is a secure authentication protocol** that enables users and services to `authenticate without transmitting 
passwords` over the network. It is built around a `trusted third-party authentication system`, using 
`tickets and encryption keys` to ensure authentication.

The Kerberos server knows "secrets" (encrypted passwords) for all clients and servers under its control. 
These "secrets" are used to encrypt all the messages exchanged during authentication.

## 1. Key components and terms of Kerberos

Below is a list of important components and terms of Kerberos:
- **Key Distribution Center(KDC)**: is responsible for checking user credentials and issuing Tickets
- **Realm**: defines a administrative domain to restrict a security scope. It includes a `KDC` and a `list of Clients(e.g. users, hosts, services)`
- **Principal**: is a **unique identity** in the Kerberos system, which can be a `user, host, or service`.
- **Ticket**: a credential issued by KDC.
- **Keytab**: A file that includes one or more principals and their keys.   


### 1.1 Key Distribution Center(KDC)

**Key Distribution Center, or KDC** is the heart of the Kerberos authentication system. At a high level, it has three parts:

   - A **database**: of the users, hosts and services (known as principals) that it knows about and their respective Kerberos passwords 
   - An **authentication server (AS)**: which performs the initial authentication and issues a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**
   - A **Ticket Granting Server (TGS)**: that issues `subsequent service tickets` based on the initial TGT for `accessing specific hosts or services`

The KDC is typically hosted on a `Domain Controller (DC) in Active Directory (AD)` or a `Kerberos server` in `MIT/Heimdal implementations`.

### 1.2 Realm 

A **Kerberos realm** defines the administrative domain. It includes a `KDC` and a `list of Clients(e.g. users, hosts, services)`
The `realm name` usually matches the `organization’s domain name, written in uppercase`. For example, if the organization
domain name is `casd.eu`, the realm name should be `CASD.EU`.

> A realm can trust another realm (cross-realm authentication) for authentication across different domains.

### 1.3 Principal

A Principal is a unique identity in the Kerberos system, which can be:

- a user (e.g., user@CASD.EU).
- a host (e.g., host/server01.casd.eu@CASD.EU).
- a service (e.g., hdfs/namenode.casd.eu@CASD.EU).

> We must distinguish the difference between an account in AD/Ldap and a principal in Kerberos. An account in AD can be
> associated with multiple principals in Kerberos.

#### 1.3.1 Naming convention of the principal

In theory, A principal in Kerberos 5 is of the following type: `component1/component2/.../componentN@REALM`

But, in practice a `maximum of two components` are used. So we recommend the below naming convention for principals.

Principal for users, we use the uid of the user and roles of the user to build the principal. In below example, user1
has two principals, `user1@CASD.EU` has normal privileges, `user1/admin@CASD.EU` has admin privileges

```text
# general form for user principal
<uid>/<role>@REALM

# examples
user1@CASD.EU
user1/admin@CASD.EU
```

Principal for hosts(servers), we use the keyword `host` to indicate this principal provides a special service
which give generic access to the machine (e.g. telnet, rsh, ssh). The second component is the `complete hostname (FQDN)` 
of the machine.

```text
# general form for host principal, 
host/<host-fqdn>@REALM

# examples
host/server.casd.eu@CASD.EU
```

> It is important that the `host-fqdn` exactly matches (in lower case letters) the DNS reverse resolution 
> of the application server's IP address

```text
# general form for service principal
<service-name>/<host-fqdn>@REALM

# examples
imap/mbox.casd.eu@CASD.EU
yarn/deb11_h01.casd.eu@CASD.EU
```

###  1.4 Ticket

A `kerberos ticket` is something a client presents to an application server to demonstrate the authenticity of its identity. 
Tickets are issued by the `authentication server` and are encrypted using the secret key of the service they are 
intended for. Since this key is a secret shared only between the `authentication server` and the `server providing 
the service`, not even the client which requested the ticket can know it or change its contents. 
The main information contained in a ticket includes:
 - The requesting user's principal (generally the username); 
 - The principal of the service it is intended for; 
 - The IP address of the client machine from which the ticket can be used. In Kerberos 5 this field is optional and may 
     also be multiple to be able to run clients under NAT or multi-home. 
 - The date and time (in timestamp format) when the tickets validity commences; 
 - The ticket's maximum lifetime 
 - The session key (this has a fundamental role which is described below);

#### 1.4.1 Ticket's maximum lifetime 

Each ticket has an expiration (generally 10 hours). This is essential since the authentication server no longer 
has any control over an already issued ticket. Even though the realm administrator can prevent the issuing of 
new tickets for a certain user at any time, it cannot prevent users from using the tickets they already possess. 
This is the reason for limiting the lifetime of the tickets to limit any abuse over time.

#### 1.4.2 Ticket Granting Ticket(TGT) VS Service Ticket(ST)

Kerberos provides two types of tickets:
- Ticket Granting Ticket(TGT): A ticket that proves the user identity to request other tickets; issued once per login session.
- Service Ticket(ST): A ticket that grants access to a specific service; issued per service request.

A `user principal` requests authentication from the `AS`. The AS returns a `TGT` that is `encrypted using the user 
principal's Kerberos password`, which is known only to the user principal and the AS. The user principal decrypts the 
TGT locally using its Kerberos password, and from that point forward, until the ticket expires, the user principal can 
use the TGT to get `service tickets(ST)` from the `TGS`. 

##### Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)

- Issued by the Authentication Service (AS) after a successful login.
- Encrypted with the user’s password.
- Allows the user to request service tickets without entering credentials again.
- Has a validity period (e.g., 10 hours) and may be renewable.

##### Service Ticket (ST)

- Issued by the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) upon request.
- Allows access to a specific service (e.g., HDFS, Spark, SSH).
- Each service requires its own ticket.
- In general, the validity period of ST should be less than TGT 

Below is an example of viewing tickets in linux

```shell
# example of viewing TGT and ST
klist

# example output
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000
Default principal: user@CASD.EU

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
03/25/25 12:00:00  03/25/25 22:00:00  krbtgt/CASD.EU@CASD.EU  (TGT)
03/25/25 12:05:00  03/25/25 22:00:00  hdfs/namenode.casd.eu@CASD.EU (Service Ticket)

```

> By default, in linux all krb tickets of a user are stored in a file /tmp/krb5cc_1000, where 1000 is the uid number 
> of the user.

Below is an example of viewing tickets in windows

```shell
# example of viewing TGT and ST
klist

# example output
Credential cache: C:\Users\user\krb5cc_user
Default principal: user@CASD.EU

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
03/25/25 12:00:00  03/25/25 22:00:00  krbtgt/CASD.EU@CASD.EU  (TGT)
03/25/25 12:05:00  03/25/25 22:00:00  hdfs/namenode.casd.eu@CASD.EU (Service Ticket)

```

> By default, in windows, all krb tickets of a user are stored in a file C:\Users\user\krb5cc_user. 

- The user principal is `user@CASD.EU`
- The first ticket with service principal `(krbtgt/CASD.EU@CASD.EU)` is the TGT. 
- The second ticket with service principal `(hdfs/namenode.casd.eu@CASD.EU)` is the Service Ticket for accessing HDFS.

### 1.5 Keytab

A `.keytab` file stores the `encrypted credentials` for `non-interactive authentication`.

It's often used by services and automated scripts to authenticate to Kerberos and request a ticket without user intervention.

A `.keytab` file can contain `one or more encryption keys` linked to a Kerberos principal. 

### 1.6 Encryption algos and keys

As we explained before, Kerberos uses `symmetric encryption algorithms` to secure authentication (e.g. tickets and keytabs).
It supports many algorithms to fits different hardware and OS requirements. Below are some supported algo
- AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 (Strongest, preferred)
- AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
- RC4-HMAC (Weaker, legacy)

```shell
# to check the encryption algo of a ticket, you can use -e option
klist -e 
```
The algo `AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96` can be break down into three parts:
- AES256: symmetric encryption algorithm which encrypts the shared secrets between user and KDC
- CTS(Ciphertext Stealing): helps encrypt data of any size without an anomaly. Because encryption works on fixed blocks of data (e.g., 16 bytes at a time)
- HMAC-SHA1-96: ensures the integrity of the ticket or credentials in the keytab file. HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)

## 2. Introduction to Kerberos Authentication protocol

**Kerberos is a network authentication protocol**. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server 
applications by using secret-key cryptography. It has the following characteristics:

- It is secure: it never sends a password unless it is encrypted.

- Only a single login is required per session. Credentials defined at login are then passed between resources without the need for additional logins.

- The concept depends on a trusted third party  a Key Distribution Center (KDC). The KDC is aware of all systems in the network and is trusted by all of them.

- It performs mutual authentication, where a client proves its identity to a server, and a server proves its identity to the client.


Kerberos introduces the concept of a **Ticket-Granting Server (TGS)**. A client that wishes to use a service has to 
receive a ticket a time-limited cryptographic message giving it access to the server. 
Kerberos also requires an **Authentication Server (AS)** to verify clients. The two servers combined make up a KDC. 

The following figure shows the sequence of events required for a client to gain access to a service using Kerberos 
authentication. Each step is shown with the Kerberos message associated with it, as defined in RFC 
4120 “The Kerberos Network Authorization Service (V5)”.

![krb_auth_steps.png](../../../../images/krb_auth_steps.png)

- Step 1: The user logs on to the workstation and requests service on the host. The workstation sends a message to 
          the Authorization Server requesting a `ticket granting ticket (TGT)`.

- Step 2: The Authorization Server verifies the user’s access rights in the user database and creates a TGT 
           and session key. The Authorization Sever encrypts the results using a key derived from the user’s 
           password and sends a message back to the user workstation. The workstation prompts the user for a 
           password and uses the password to decrypt the incoming message. When decryption succeeds, the user will 
           be able to use the TGT to request a `service ticket`.

- Step 3: When the user wants access to a service, the workstation client application sends a request to the Ticket 
          Granting Service containing the client name, realm name and a timestamp. The user proves his identity by 
          sending an authenticator encrypted with the session key received in Step 2.

- Step 4: The TGS decrypts the ticket and authenticator, verifies the request, and creates a ticket for the 
           requested server. The ticket contains the client name and optionally the client IP address. It also 
            contains the realm name and ticket lifespan. The TGS returns the ticket to the user workstation. 
           The returned message contains two copies of a server session key  one encrypted with the client password, 
           and one encrypted by the service password.

- Step 5: The client application now sends a service request to the server containing the ticket received in Step 
          4 and an authenticator. The service authenticates the request by decrypting the session key. The server 
         verifies that the ticket and authenticator match, and then grants access to the service. This step as 
         described does not include the authorization performed by the Intel AMT device, as described later.

- Step 6: If mutual authentication is required, then the server will reply with a server authentication message.

## 3. Time synchronization

To prevent `replay attacks`, Kerberos uses `timestamps` as part of its protocol definition. For timestamps to 
work properly, the `clocks of the client and the server need to be in synch as much as possible`. Since the 
clocks of two computers are often out of synch, administrators can establish a policy to establish the 
maximum acceptable difference to Kerberos between a client's clock and server's clock. If the difference between 
a client's clock and the server's clock is less than the maximum time difference specified in this policy, any timestamp used in a session between the two computers will be 
considered authentic. The maximum difference is usually set to five minutes.

> Note that if a client application wishes to use a service that is "Kerberized" (the service is configured to perform 
  Kerberos authentication), the client must also be Kerberized so that it expects to support the necessary message responses.
