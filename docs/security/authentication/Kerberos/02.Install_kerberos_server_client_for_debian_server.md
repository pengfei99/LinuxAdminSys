# Install Kerberos server and client on debian

In this tutorial, we will install MIT Kerberos server and client on a debian 11 server.


## 1. Prerequisite

### 1.1 Setup NTP server
As we mentioned above, kerberos is time sensitive, we need to use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server to synchronize 
the time. You can follow this page https://vitux.com/how-to-setup-ntp-server-and-client-on-debian-11/

### 1.2 DNS server setup
Before installing the Kerberos server, a properly configured DNS server is needed for your domain. 
Since the Kerberos Realm by convention matches the domain name.


### 1.3 Some basic krb information

Realm: CASD.LOCAL
KDC server url: kdc01.casd.local (10.50.5.57)
backup KDC server url: kdc02.casd.local (not deployed for now)
admin principal: pliu/admin
user principal: hadoop


**It is strongly recommended that your network-authenticated users have their uid in a different range (say, starting at 5000) than that of your local users.**


## 2. Server Installation

For the server side, we will install an `MIT kerberos V5`. As we mentioned above, **a KDC requires an Authentication Server (AS) and Ticket-Granting Server (TGS)**
To manage the KDC server, we need some admin tools which will be provided by the **krb5-admin-server**

```shell
# step 1:  install the krb5-kdc and krb5-admin-server packages.
sudo apt install krb5-kdc krb5-admin-server

# 1st prompt will ask you the default REALM name, enter CASD.LOCAL
# 2nd prompt will ask you the url/ip of the kdc server url, enter kdc01.casd.local or ip, if you have two kdc server, you can use space to separate them.
# 3rd prompt will ask you the url/ip of the admin server url, enter kdc01.casd.local or ip(we install it on the same). 

# step2: create a new realm
# The default realm in step 1 is the configuration for connection. We need to create the realm
sudo krb5_newrealm
# suppose the reaml name is CASD.LOCAL

# step3: create principals(user account) by using admin tools
# login to admin tools 
sudo kadmin.local

# create new principals (user accounts)
# note the / in pliu/admin here is only for human, nothing special for kdc.
# as we did not specify the realm, the default realm will be added to the principals
kadmin.local: addprinc pliu/admin
kadmin.local: addprinc hadoop

# step4: Add the appropriate Access Control List (ACL) permissions for the new admin user.
sudo vim /etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl
# add below lines
pliu/admin@CASD.LOCAL  *
# The above line grants pliu/admin the ability to perform any operation on all principals in the realm. You can 
# configure principals with more restrictive privileges.

# step5: restart the krb5-admin-server for the new ACL to take affect
sudo systemctl restart krb5-admin-server.service

```

In this setup, the KDC uses a local database to store user login/password; we can connect kerberos to a ldap server.

## 3. Server configuration

There are three main config files you need to pay attention:
- /etc/krb5.conf
- /etc/krb5kdc/kdc.conf
- /etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl

### 3.1 /etc/krb5.conf (Kerberos Client & General Configuration)

This configuration file is `required` by both `krb clients` and the `KDC server` to specify general `Kerberos settings`.
It has three key sections:
- `[libdefaults]`: General Kerberos settings (default realm, ticket options).
- `[realms]`: Defines realms and their corresponding KDC and admin server.
- `[domain_realm]`: Maps domain names to Kerberos realms.

Below is an example of the `krb5.conf`
```ini
[libdefaults]
    default_realm = CASD.EU
    ticket_lifetime = 24h
    renew_lifetime = 7d
    forwardable = true
    dns_lookup_kdc = false

[realms]
    CASD.EU = {
        kdc = kdc.casd.eu
        admin_server = kdc.casd.eu
        default_domain = casd.eu
    }

[domain_realm]
    .casd.eu = CASD.EU
    casd.eu = CASD.EU

```

### 3.2 /etc/krb5kdc/kdc.conf (KDC-Specific Configuration)

This configuration file is only used by the KDC (Key Distribution Center). It controls `how the KDC manages 
authentication, tickets, and encryption`.

It has three key section:
- `[kdcdefaults]`: Defines which ports the KDC listens on.
- `[realms]`: KDC-specific settings for managing tickets, database, and encryption of a domain.

```ini
[kdcdefaults]
    kdc_ports = 88
    kdc_tcp_ports = 88

[realms]
    CASD.EU = {
        database_name = /var/lib/krb5kdc/principal
        admin_keytab = /etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab
        acl_file = /etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl
        dict_file = /usr/share/dict/words
        key_stash_file = /etc/krb5kdc/stash
        max_life = 24h
        max_renewable_life = 7d
        supported_enctypes = aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96:normal aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96:normal
    }

```

### 3.3 /etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl (ACL for KDC)

The `/etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl` file controls who can manage Kerberos principals (users, services, and hosts).

```shell
# general form 
principal  privilege

# some example
# the admin principal has full admin access  (can add/delete principal, reset passwords, etc.)
admin@CASD.EU  *
# user1 can change their own password but nothing else
user1@CASD.EU  x
# service/admin can add and change principals, but not delete them
service/admin@CASD.EU  ac
```

| Symbol | Privilege           |
|--------|---------------------|
| *      | Full access         |
| a      | Add principal       |
| d      | Delete principal    |
| m      | Modify principal    |
| c      | Change password     |
| x      | Change own password |




## 4. Client installation

You will now need to configure a Linux system as a Kerberos client. This will allow access to any kerberized services 
once a user has successfully logged into the system.


```shell
# step1: install packages
sudo apt install krb5-user 

# step2: Configure the krb client config
sudo dpkg-reconfigure krb5-config
# The dpkg-reconfigure adds entries to the /etc/krb5.conf file for your Realm. You should have entries similar to the following:
[libdefaults]
        default_realm = CASD.LOCAL
...
[realms]
        CASD.LOCAL = {
                kdc = 10.50.5.57
                admin_server = 10.50.5.57
        }
        
# step3: Test the configuration by requesting a ticket using the kinit utility
kinit pliu@CASD.LOCAL

# step4: Check the generated ticket
klist 

```
> if you want to use krb for ssh authentication, you need to install libpam-krb5 libpam-ccreds auth-client-config
> `sudo auth-client-config -a -p kerberos_example` use the `auth-client-config` to configure the `libpam-krb5` module 
> to request a ticket during login


### 4.1 kadmin

**kadmin** and **kadmin.local** are command-line interfaces to the Kerberos V5 administration system. They provide 
nearly identical functionalities; the difference is that `kadmin.local directly accesses the KDC database`, while 
`kadmin performs operations using kadmind`.

With `sudo kadmin.local` you have the admin console in the krb server locally. You can also access the admin console 
remotely. You can find the complete doc [here](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/admin_commands/kadmin_local.html).

### 4.2 kutil

The ktutil command invokes a command interface from which an administrator can read, write, or edit 
entries in a keytab or Kerberos V4 srvtab file. You can find the detailed documentation of [ktutil](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/admin_commands/ktutil.html)

Create a new keytab with existing principal and password. We can choose different encryption algorithm

```shell
ktutil:  add_entry -password -p pengfei@CASD.LOCAL -k 1 -e
    aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96
Password for pengfei@CASD.LOCAL:
ktutil:  add_entry -password -p pengfei@CASD.LOCAL -k 1 -e
    aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96
Password for pengfei@CASD.LOCAL:
ktutil:  write_kt keytab
ktutil:
```

Read an existing keytab

``` shell
ktutil:  read_kt /etc/krb5.keytab 
ktutil:  list
slot KVNO Principal
---- ---- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   1    2     host/sssd-test.casd.local@CASD.LOCAL
   2    2     host/sssd-test.casd.local@CASD.LOCAL
   3    2 auth-agent/sssd-test.casd.local@CASD.LOCAL
   4    2 auth-agent/sssd-test.casd.local@CASD.LOCAL
```
