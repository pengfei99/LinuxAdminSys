# Configure a shared folder in linux

The goal of this tutorial is to show how to set up a shared folder for all users. Users must be able to access data
inside this folder (read only by default) without the owner of the data changing the acl manually.

> The command such as `cp, mv` conserve the origin ACL of the data, so even the default ACL of the shared folder
> allows all users to access the data, but if the data is created in another folder and copied in the shared folder,
> by default the data conserves the origin ACL. As a result, the data may not be accessible
> 

The idea is :
1. create a shared folder called `/home/common`
2. set default ACL to o::rw (give others read, write rights, if read-only, remove w)
3. set up a systemd to auto change ACL, when copy or move data to the shared folder



## 1. Create the shared folder

```shell
# the owner and group will be root:root
sudo mkdir /home/common
```

## 2. Setup default ACL for the shared folder

Run the below command to install the required packages

```shell
# install required packages
sudo apt update

sudo apt install inotify-tools acl -y
```

- **acl**: offers more options than basic chmod
- **inotify-tools**: overwatch a folder, when a waiting event happens, it can trigger target actions

Configure default ACL 

```shell
# by default we recommend read only for all users. For the owner and group, the origin ACL will be conserved.
sudo setfacl -d -m o::r /home/common
```


> After this step, all files and folders created in the shared folder will inherit the default ACL
> 

## 3. Configure a systemd daemon to auto update ACL

### 3.1 Create the daemon script

Create the daemon script in `/usr/local/bin`

```shell
# choose your favorite editor
sudo vim /usr/local/bin/update_acl.sh
```

Copy the below script in the file

```shell

#!/bin/bash

# the dir which the daemon will watch
WATCH_DIR="/home/common"
# the ACL will be enforced by the daemon
ACL_PERMISSIONS="o::r-x"

inotifywait -m -r -e close_write,moved_to,create "$WATCH_DIR" --format "%w%f" |
while read NEWITEM; do
  # check if the new coming item is a directory or a file
    if [ -d "$NEWITEM" ]; then
        echo "Fixing ACL for new directory: $NEWITEM"
        # -R means recursively update the ACL of the new directory.
        setfacl -R -m "$ACL_PERMISSIONS" "$NEWITEM"
        # -d sets default ACL so future files in the new directory inherit correct permissions.
        setfacl -d -m "$ACL_PERMISSIONS" "$NEWITEM"
    else
        echo "Fixing ACL for new file: $NEWITEM"
        setfacl -m "$ACL_PERMISSIONS" "$NEWITEM"
    fi
done

```

make the script executable

```shell
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/update_acl.sh
```

### 3.2 Create the systemd daemon launcher for update_acl.sh

The systemd daemon launcher must be located at `/etc/systemd/system/`. By convention, we name it as `update_acl.service`

Open the file with your favorite editor

```shell
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/update_acl.service
```

Copy the below lines in the file

```shell
[Unit]
Description=Update ACLs for date copied to shared directory
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/update_acl.sh
Restart=always
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

### 3.3 Enable the systemd daemon

```shell
# reload the daemon list from the repository
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# enable the service for startup
sudo systemctl enable update_acl.service

# start the service 
sudo systemctl start update_acl.service

# check the satus
sudo systemctl status update_acl.service

# stop the service
sudo systemctl stop update_acl.service
```


## 4. Test the solution

After the above steps, you need to login to the server with two different users:
- user1
- user2


user1 actions

```shell
#  create a file in his home
touch ~/test1.txt

# set the acl to owner only, 
chmod 0700 ~/test.txt

# copy the file to the /home/common
cp ~/test.txt /home/common

# create a file directly in the shared folder
cd /home/common

# create a file
touch test2.txt
```

user2 actions

```shell
# go to the share folder
cd /home/common

# list the existing files
ls -lah

# show the content of test1 and test2
cat test1.txt
cat test2.txt
```

If user2 can show the content, it means the daemon works well. If user2 see `permission deny`, it means something went wrong.
Call admin linux
