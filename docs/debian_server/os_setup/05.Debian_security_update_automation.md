# Debian security updates automation

## 1. Apply updates manually

```shell
# fetch repo updates
sudo apt-get update

#  list all available upgrades
sudo apt list --upgradable

# install updates
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

If your linux kernel is updated, we recommend you to reboot your OS to check if everything is ok

```shell
# restart 
sudo shutdown -r now

# show the kernel version
uname -mrs
```

A script which can automate the process via cron job

```shell

#!/bin/bash
export NEEDRESTART_MODE=a
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
## Questions that you really, really need to see (or else). ##
export DEBIAN_PRIORITY=critical
apt-get -qy clean
apt-get -qy update
apt-get -qy -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef" -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold" upgrade

```

You can notice, we set special shell variable named **DEBIAN_FRONTEND, NEEDRESTART_MODE, and DEBIAN_PRIORITY** to 
avoid issues when running task in the backround via cron job.

## 2. Use the unattended-upgrades package

There is a package called **unattended-upgrades**, which can install the security updates automatically in the background.
We also recommend two more packages:
- **apt-listchanges**: can compare a new package version with the one currently installed and show what has been 
                       changed by extracting the relevant entries from the Debian changelog and NEWS files.
- **bsd-mailx**: traditional simple command-line-mode mail user agent

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges bsd-mailx
```

The objective of the three tools, `unattended-upgrades` install the updates, `apt-listchanges` log the changes 
during the update, `bsd-mailx` send the log to user mail box.

You can control the `unattended-upgrades` daemons with the below command.

```shell
systemctl start unattended-upgrades # start the service
systemctl stop unattended-upgrades # stop the service
systemctl restart unattended-upgrades # restart the service
systemctl enable unattended-upgrades # enable at boot time
systemctl disable unattended-upgrades # disable at boot time
systemctl status unattended-upgrades # get the status
```

### 2.1 Configure the unattended-upgrades daemon

There are two important conf files for `unattended-upgrades` daemon:
- **/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades**: it's auto generated after the installation of `unattended-upgrades`
- **/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades**: You need to add it manually or call `sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades`
                                      to generate this config file

#### 2.1.1 50unattended-upgrades

This conf file set up the package repo origin. Below is an example

```shell
    "origin=Debian,codename=${distro_codename},label=Debian";
    "origin=Debian,codename=${distro_codename},label=Debian-Security";
    "origin=Debian,codename=${distro_codename}-security,label=Debian-Security";
```
You can skip packages by using blacklist

```shell
// Use python regular expression
// 
Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist {
	"nginx";
        "linux-image*";
};
```

You need to configure an email address to get email when there is a problem or package upgrades:

```shell
Unattended-Upgrade::Mail "notify@server1.cyberciti.biz";
# Or at least send it to root user on the same system:
# You can access root mail from /var/mails via root account
Unattended-Upgrade::Mail "root";

```

#### 2.1.2 /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades

This config file activates the `unattended-upgrades` daemon. It also sets how often the apt clean the unnecessary packages.

If you run the below a command, with the prompt UI, you can generate this config file automatically.

```shell
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
```

We recommend you add at least the below three lines in this config file.
```shell
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
```
## 2.2. Configure the apt-listchanges

The main config file of this daemon is  `/etc/apt/listchanges.conf`. Below is an example

```shell
[apt]
frontend=pager
which=news
email_address=root
email_format=text
confirm=false
headers=false
reverse=false
save_seen=/var/lib/apt/listchanges.db

```

> change the mail_address if you want to redirect the mail to another mail box.
> 

### 2.3 Test your installation

```shell
sudo unattended-upgrades --dry-run --debug
```

## 3. View and config the upgrade schedules

In debian `Debian 11/10` **Unattended Upgrades** daemon uses `systemd timer` to schedules the updates. 
To view schedule value, use the below command

```shell
# schedules used for download packages
systemctl cat apt-daily.timer 

# output example
# /lib/systemd/system/apt-daily.timer
[Unit]
Description=Daily apt download activities

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 6,18:00
RandomizedDelaySec=12h
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target


# schedules used for upgrade packages
systemctl cat apt-daily-upgrade.timer

# output example
# /lib/systemd/system/apt-daily-upgrade.timer
[Unit]
Description=Daily apt upgrade and clean activities
After=apt-daily.timer

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 6:00
RandomizedDelaySec=60m
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

```

### 3.1 Modify the default schedules

Edit the schedules used for download packages
```shell
systemctl edit apt-daily.timer 
# restart the service
sudo systemctl restart apt-daily.timer 
# check the status
systemctl status apt-daily.timer 
```

Edit the schedules used for upgrade packages

```shell
systemctl edit apt-daily-upgrade.timer
sudo systemctl restart apt-daily-upgrade.timerr
systemctl status apt-daily-upgrade.timer
```

## 4. Trouble shoot

If you encounter problems, you can check the log of the `unattended-upgrades` daemon. 

```shell
tail -f /var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades-shutdown.log
```
