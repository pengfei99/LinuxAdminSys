# Accept private ca certificate

If you want your server to accept custom certificates, you can follow the below steps.
There are two scenarios:
 1. You have a self-signed certificate  
 2. You have a certificate which signed by a CA, but the CA is not recognized by the server by default.

For `scenario 1`, you just copy the self-signed certificate. For `scenario 2`, you should
copy the root CA certificate, so all the certificate signed by this CA will be accepted
in the future.

## 1. Convert certificate to accepted format
> Debian only accepts certificate of format .crt or .pem. If your certificate is in other formats, you need to
> convert them into the accepted format

```shell
# convert der to crt
openssl x509 \
       -inform der -in domain.der \
       -out domain.crt

# convert pcks7 to crt
openssl pkcs7 \
       -in domain.p7b \
       -print_certs -out domain.crt
       
# convert pkcs12 to crt
openssl pkcs12 \
       -in domain.pfx \
       -nodes -out domain.combined.crt
```

> Certain certificate format contains also the private key, so pay attention on the output file, don't leak the private
> key.

## 2. Add certificate as trusted

```shell
# to keep track off the custom ca we create a sub-folder
sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/casd-ca

# copy the certificate
sudo cp your-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/casd-ca/.

# ask debian to load the new certificate
sudo update-ca-certificates

# test it with a site which uses the certificate or signed by the certificate
curl https://target-url
```
