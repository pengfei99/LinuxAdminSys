# Configure debian server sshd auth with pam, sssd, kerberos

There is a complete tutorial on how to setup openldap, kerberos for unified authentication. You can visit
this [website](https://www.infoq.cn/article/s1ngm7eubqer9bw8xhk4).

In this tutorial, we show a scenario light compares to the architecture which shows in the above tutorial. 
We don't use the `SASL/GSSAPI` to delegate user password check to kerberos.

It means, in the below tutorial, user has a password in openldap, and a password in kerberos, which are not synchronized
automatically. The **user id** does the link of user between openldap and kerberos.


Suppose we have a ldap and kerberos server running on `10.50.5.200` with url as `krb.casd.local`.

suppose we have three servers:
- krb.casd.local: server hosts openldap and kerberos (can be replaced by AD/kerberos)
- ssh-server.casd.local: server runs sshd server which uses pam, sssd, sssd-krb5 to check user authentication
- ssh-client.casd.local: a vm runs an ssh client and krb5-client, user can get a kerberos ticket, and use this ticket to ssh
                           into the ssh-server.casd.local

The full authentication process:
1. user get a kerberos ticket (kinit <user-principal>) (in ssh-client.casd.local)
2. user init an ssh connection with the cached kerberos ticket(ssh uid@ssh-server.casd.local) (in ssh-client.casd.local)
3. ssh-server receives the ssh connection requests (sshd config checks all the possible authentication methods) (in ssh-server.casd.local)
4. `sshd` delegate the authentication to `pam`(`UsePAM yes in sshd_config`), `pam` delegate to `sssd`, `sssd` delegate to `sssd-krb5`. Because we set `auth_provider`
      as `krb5` in `sssd`. (in ssh-server.casd.local)
5. `sssd-krb5` sends a request to `krb.casd.local` to verify the authenticity of the kerberos ticket. This steps requires `ssh-server.casd.local`
    has a valid principal in `krb.casd.local` (in ssh-server.casd.local)
6. `krb.casd.local` verify the ticket and send the result back to `ssh-server.casd.local`. (in krb.casd.local)
7. `sssd-krb5` in `ssh-server.casd.local` receives the result, if ok, it will ask the `id_provider` of the `sssd`, 
      in our case it's `openldap` to get `uid` and `gid` of the user with the uid of the kerberos ticket. The user
      `uid` and `gid` information will be transfer to `nss`. `sssd` tells pam it's ok, `pam` tells sshd it's ok.
     Then pam will create a user session in the server after user login. (in ssh-server.casd.local)
8. user will get a terminal on `ssh-server.casd.local` with uid and gids from the `openldap` account.

## 1. Configure and test krb client on ssh-client.casd.local and ssh-server.casd.local

We need to install the kerberos client on both servers:
- ssh-client.casd.local
- ssh-server.casd.local

### 1.1 Install the required packages

```shell
# krb client package
sudo apt install krb5-user
```

### 1.2 Configure the krb client

```shell
sudo vim /etc/krb5.conf

# add the below content
[libdefaults]
	default_realm = CASD.LOCAL

# The following krb5.conf variables are only for MIT Kerberos.
	kdc_timesync = 1
	ccache_type = 4
	forwardable = true
	proxiable = true
        rdns = false


# The following libdefaults parameters are only for Heimdal Kerberos.
	fcc-mit-ticketflags = true

[realms]
	CASD.LOCAL = {
		kdc = krb.casd.local
		admin_server = krb.casd.local
	}
        

[domain_realm]
        casd.local = CASD.LOCAL
        .casd.local = CASD.LOCAL

```

### 1.3 Test the client

```shell
# generate a ticket, the principal must exist in the krb server
kinit pliu@CASD.LOCAL

# normally, you can view the ticket
klist

# clean the ticket
kdestory
```

## 2. Config sshd, pam, sssd on ssh-server.casd.local

### 2.1 Install required packages

```shell
sudo apt install sssd sssd-tools libnss-sss libpam-sss libpam-mkhomedir
```

- **sssd**: package for daemon sssd((System Security Services Daemon))
- **sssd-tools**: provides command-line utilities for managing and troubleshooting SSSD
- **nss**: NSS (Name Service Switch) is a subsystem in Linux and Unix-like systems that allows applications 
         to retrieve information about users, groups, hosts, networks, services, and more from various 
         sources (like /etc/passwd, LDAP, NIS, or SSSD). By default, this daemon is running on a debian server, 
         no need to install the package. The main config is in `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
- **libnss-sss**: This daemon allows `nss` to retrieve user information from `sssd`
- **libpam-sss**: This daemon allows `pam` to use `sssd` as an authentication mechanism. 
- **libpam-mkhomedir**: This daemon allows `pam` to create home dir for newly connected users.

## 2.2 Configure sshd to use pam as an authentication mechanism

```shell
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf

#Port 22
#AddressFamily any
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
#ListenAddress ::

#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key

# Expect .ssh/authorized_keys2 to be disregarded by default in future.
#AuthorizedKeysFile	.ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2

#AuthorizedPrincipalsFile none

#AuthorizedKeysCommand none
#AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody

# For this to work you will also need host keys in /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
#HostbasedAuthentication no
# Change to yes if you don't trust ~/.ssh/known_hosts for
# HostbasedAuthentication
#IgnoreUserKnownHosts no
# Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files
#IgnoreRhosts yes

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
#PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with
# some PAM modules and threads)
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
#AuthenticationMethods gssapi-with-mic,password

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.

### 2.3 configure pam to use sssd

`pam` has a list of configuration files(located in `/etc/pam.d/`):
- **common-auth**: user authentication 
- **common-account**: User account management
- **common-password**: Allow user to modify password.
- **common-session**: user session settings

#### 2.3.1 common-auth

The simplest config example :

```shell
auth      sufficient  pam_unix.so
auth      sufficient  pam_sss.so use_first_pass
auth      required    pam_deny.so
```
pam_unix.so: Uses local account to authenticate users
pam_sss.so use_first_pass: Uses SSSD as first method to authenticate users.
pam_deny.so: Denies access if all the above authentication method fails.
pam_permit.so: Allows authentication if all previous steps succeed.

#### 2.3.2 common-account

This controls how the user account can interact with the system. 
Below is a simple config example. 
```shell
account   required    pam_unix.so
account   sufficient  pam_sss.so
account   required    pam_permit.so
```

> **don't** add `account requisite  pam_deny.so` in the config, otherwise you can no longer become root with sudoers right.

#### 2.3.3 common-password: 

Allow user to modify password.

```shell
password  sufficient  pam_unix.so nullok md5 shadow use_authtok
password  sufficient  pam_sss.so try_first_pass
password  required    pam_deny.so

```

> This configuration is not enough for user to change password. You need to change sssd, ldap/kerberos config to 
> allow users to change their passwords through sssd, Kerberos/LDAP.
 
#### 2.3.4 common-session

```shell
session   required    pam_unix.so
session   optional    pam_sss.so
session   required    pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel/ umask=0022

```
pam_mkhomedir.so: Create a home directory on first login if it doesnâ€™t exist with umask=0022.
pam_sss.so: Ensures SSSD session modules are applied.

### 2.4 Configure NSS

Ensure SSSD is used for user and group lookup.

The NSS (Name Service Switch) main config is located at `/etc/nsswitch.conf`:


The following config is a simple example tells Linux to check both local files (/etc/passwd) and SSSD for user information.

```shell
sudo vim /etc/nsswitch.conf

passwd:         files sss
group:          files sss
shadow:         files sss
```


### 2.5 Configure sssd


```shell
[sssd]
services = nss, pam, ssh
domains = casd.local
config_file_version = 2

[domain/casd.local]
id_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://krb.casd.local
ldap_search_base = dc=casd,dc=local

auth_provider = krb5
chpass_provider = krb5
krb5_realm = CASD.LOCAL
krb5_server = krb.casd.local
krb5_kpasswd = krb.casd.local
debug_level = 5
krb5_validate = true
krb5_ccachedir = /var/tmp # note that RHEL-7 default to KERNEL ccaches, which are preferred in most cases to FILE
krb5_keytab = /etc/krb5.keytab
cache_credentials = true

override_homedir = /home/%u
default_shell = /bin/bash


[nss]
homedir_substring = /home

[pam]


```
