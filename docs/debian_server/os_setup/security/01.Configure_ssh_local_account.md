# Configure ssh server on debian 11

An `SSH Server` is a service that runs as a `daemon background process (systemd service)` on a computer (server) and 
allows `secure remote access` using the `Secure Shell (SSH) protocol`. 

It listens for incoming connections on `port 22 (by default)`. It then authenticates users, creates a 
secure encrypted session, and allows remote execution of commands.

It enables users to:
  - Log in remotely by using `passwords, SSH keys, or Kerberos authentication`.
  - Execute commands on a remote system.
  - Transfer files securely (using scp or sftp).
  - Forward network connections (port forwarding, tunneling).
